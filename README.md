# Rails Mister Cocktail

This is a Rails project I did as part of [Le Wagon's](https://www.lewagon.com/) Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp (Batch #454, [Singapore](https://www.lewagon.com/singapore)). The Mister Cocktail assignment is to build a cocktail recipe manager using Rails. I am too cheap to pay for [TheCocktailDB's](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) $2 a month API (I don't drink, anyway), so the seed contains wildly inaccurate information about how to make a range of cocktails.

## To-do list
- [x] Paginate all cocktails page
- [x] Enlarge Mister Cocktail header on navbar
- [ ] Fix responsive layout for navbar (menu items align left instead of right)
- [ ] Fix responsive layout on show page (content is slightly off-centre)
- [ ] Fix responsive layout on new page (content is slightly off-centre)
- [ ] Add About page
